<h1>A break from Covid</h1>

<h2>The survival kit</h2>
<p>With the anxiety, fear and occasional panic associated with
the pandemic and the possibly imminent collapse of democratic
government in the US,
I began over the summer to think about what I'd need to survive if 
civilization as we know it were in fact to perish.
While a world with no electricity or internet, with real
violence in the streets
seemed unlikely when I considered it rationally, I felt it. Like many,
I had been worrying for some time what social collapse due
to climate change might look like. Then the West Coast fires in late
summer filled the air with smoke, so that Seattle air quality
was among the worst in the world. It was hard to breathe, and 
local officials recommending to stay indoors with windows
closed. The recent
past had thus shown how quickly and unpredictably devastating events can unfold:
Trump, Covid, the fires. Before they happened, they weren't
realities I had thought about, with the partial exception of the fires, which had
happened before with lesser magnitude. As I increasingly contemplated the fragility of 
my immediate environment and the various processes and supply
chains on which I depend, I began acquiring the components of
a survival kit that was to enable me to survive indefinitely
nourishing myself from the fruits of nature.</p>

<p>I bought a bigger tent than the tiny, light one I had, noticed that it was heavier
and bulkier, but I couldn't imagine living in the small one for more than 2 nights.
There was really no room to sleep once you unpacked a full backpack inside or even, 
for a tall person like me, to stretch out in the morning when waking up. I included 
a hatchet and a shovel as essential necessities, as well as a hunting knife. I obsessively checked 
YouTube videos and other online reviews to determine which hatchet and hunting knife would suit best my
needs. I found a shovel at REI that looked big enough to actually dig and that reminded
me of one I had used as a Boy Scout in my teens.</p>

<p>The kit grew, and time passed. In October, as the election approached and the
fear of violence in the streets seemed increasingly warranted. The
media had bifurcated into radically different narratives, leaving
some degree of doubt as to what reality we were even
experiencing.  Both the left- and the rightwing media
were portraying Seattle, where I live, as a hotbed of ongoing riots but which I was seeing
before my very eyes as perfectly safe and peaceful. My
conversations with people in Oklahoma usually included someone
asking if I was ok up here as well as news about someone down
there having been infected with Covid. I went over to the CHOP
and later the CHAZ several times to pick up art supplies. Pine
Street  was blocked off for a few blocks,
and there were too many people, most of them diligently wearing masks, for me to want
to go into the thick of it during a pandemic with social
distancing rules recommended,
but all I saw were people singing, making anti-Trump speeches, and waving protest
signs. Blick Art Supply right next door remained open throughout
and was usually my reason
for being in the area. The difference was egregious between a reality completely
unthreatening to the average person (somewhat more no doubt for
protesters committed to living there, as there was at least one
instance of someone getting shot)
and its ominous portrayal in the media.</p>

<p>So in October, with the election approaching, I became more serious
about assembling a survival kit that would be actually usable in a pinch. As the days passed
after the election, it slowly became clear, not through a momentary event as
had been normal for my lifetime in US elections with the losing candidate
conceding and no one disputing who had won. Even in the Florida recount for
Bush-Gore, there was no question that either candidate would contest the results of
the process codified in law. This time, it was a low process. After a few days we knew
the results, but Trump was still disputing them. Slowly his frivolous lawsuits
were dismissed, and even the Murdoch media was getting behind the reality that
Biden had won.</p>

<h2>The decision</h2>

<p>As I began to feel some relief at least from my socio-political anxieties, I
started thinking that testing my kit with a winter camping trip
would be a good way to reset and get away from the endless stream of 
disconcerting news and the frustration of social distancing. I began asking a few people
if they would be interested in joining. First, of course, my Goddess, who
seemed to want to see me do this on my own, then
a few other friends. One of them realized that this was a fairly
hardcore project, a fact to which I had been somewhat oblivious
and was even after our conversation. She mentioned that the cold
ground would really suck up body heat and recommended a blanket
to put under my sleeping bag, which, I assured her, was rated for winter conditions.
And she suggested getting a gas stove of a particular type that would
provide immediate heat. While I saw the appeal of the gas stove, my principle of using
only items that were potentially sustainable long-term excluded it. I was planning on using
wood only, and while a head start might be allowed by bringing in some purchased firewood,
once I was set up, I wanted to be using only wood I could find near camp. I did, however,
research what she was saying about staying warm, and her observations on that aspect
resulted in one of the greatest successes of the trip. I ended up getting a mountaineering
air mattress, which REI rates by seasons, and this one was supposed to be fine for camping
on snow, which I was intending to avoid. By this time, I had my eye on the Olympic Peninsula,
near the coast or at least at lower altitudes. I didn't want the complication
of having to deal with possible freezes, meaning your containers could break and that you
might need a fire for melting the ice to get water. So, while not expecting 
anything below freezing, and only a very soft freeze if at all (the morning I left, there was
frost on my car windshield), I went for a fancy, thermally fancy air
mattress, and got a silk cocoon sleeping bag insert, which was supposed to the sleeping bag's insulation so that its comfort zone
would include 6&#176; C. colder temperatures than what it would otherwise be suitable for. Combing the web for 
other measures to sleep warm, I further found at REI silk long underwear that I could use as pyjamas. 
They have the texture and appearance of panty hose, and are equally see-through.
Using all of the above, I thankfully did stay warm  the whole night I woke up feeling
rested, warm from the inside, and energetic. I've slept cold before during the summer
in Arkansas and Oklahoma due to inadequate
camping gear, and it was truly miserable. In the cold weather, it would
have really been a bummer to wake up the next morning feeling irritable and tired.
I'm the kind of person who can persevere even under adverse conditions
if I can at least get a good night's sleep! And I have Emily to thank for that.</p>

<p>The essential principle of my survival kit was, as I mentioned, sustainability.
I interpreted that not to take into account equipment wearing out or breaking but otherwise
to mean that I could survive indefinitely with the supplies I was carrying.
I really wanted to find a spot where I could try out the Cuban yoyo I had 
discovered as a very basic setup for fishing. I felt like fish were really the best
thing to eat in winter, with tasty edible plants more difficult to find in the
cold months, and deer being complicated to hang, cut and store properly.
Game birds are hard to hit with anything but a shotgun, which with ammo
would far exceed the weight constraints I was trying to be aware of. 
I began pondering in my head the minimum needed for fishing. Maybe just a
fish hook and something to use as fishing line? Then I thought it would be worth
it to have some kind of minimal spool for the line. The fishing rod,
I'm guessing, is a tool suited to being better able to land the fish, certainly
a very important aspect. It seemed to me like it would be at least worth a try
to see if I could land an actual fish on a Cuban yoy, which is just a plastic
spool customized so that one can let the line unspool easily from one side and 
with a special groove for your fingers to grip it while throwing. I have yet to
find out how hard it is to land a fish with the basic Cuban yoyo.</p>

<p>For the survivalist idea, my principle was that I could bring in some things to get
me started, including dry firewood, city water and freeze-dried food pouches, but
those were just to get me through until I could set myself up to live off
of foraged food. I needed clothes to stay warm, tools for building fire, and, for 
my first attempt, enough food to last for the whole trip. I had gotten
solar rechargeable plasma lighters as my primary fire-starting tool
because they were indeed rechargeable with my solar battery pack, hence
sustainable. At the last minute, however, I started thinking that I should
get some backups for fire-starting, since I wasn't taking any
ready-made tinder, and I'm used to starting fire under conditions where
I can throw an unlimited amount of paper in to keep a flame going. So I got
some huge waterproof long-burning matches, some fire-starting pellets, and 
a fire steel. As it turned out, this was a great call. The plasma lighters were completely
useless for igniting a campfire, which did turn out harder than expected.</p>

<p>And now I was looking into the concrete where and when. The ranger at REI
recommended the Queets River for my purposes. I remember emphasizing fishing
more with him but realized that might be over-ambitious. So when I called
the rangers in Olympic National Park, the guy said that I wouldn't be 
able to go anywhere on the Queets without a boat because it was flooded
immediately at the trailhead. So he recommended Ellen Creek north of Rialto
Beach toward this cool rock formation called Hole-in-the-Wall. Ellen Creek would be my
fresh water source, as getting my own filtered water was part of the 
core of the survivalist adventure. And I checked the weather, where rain wasn't
predicted and thankfully didn't happen, probably should have gone a day
sooner, as the Wednesday I arrived was actually sunny, as predicted. But I was
waiting on a few pieces of survivalist gear, specifically a pair
of Arc'teryx pants
that I wanted to try (and turned out to be great!). So I ended up having a very
pretty day of arrival but the next day was cloudy, and it tried to rain briefly.</p>

<h2>The outing</h2>
<p>So, the evening of, I tried for the first time to pack my backpack, and my backpack
wasn't big enough with the bear canister and all. So I rushed to REI to get
a bigger bagpack, which was this really nice Osprey backpack that did a fabulous
job of holding together this huge load of equipment and food. Repacked the pack,
and since I had organized everything into packing cubes, like a fire-starting kit,
long underwear kit, etc., I could repack it pretty easily, and it was
plenty big, but it was feeling pretty heavy, although I had really tried
to keep it to these REI freeze-dried meals, I had bought a lot of them
in the hope that I could make it two full days and three full nights. I'm still the
night after returning trying to figure out why it was so heavy. I weighed it
at 26.2 kg. Ok, so I would wear my kneepads to help lubricate my knees, and I would
use my trekking poles. The trail was supposed to be easy.</p>

<p>So, I was packed up the night before. I had bought some firewood to
be able to get something started at least, in case maybe I would have to walk a
distance to get firewood. And I brought 15 litres of city water in case there were
issues with getting acceptable filtered water. Loaded those in the car
the evening before, then actually got this monstrous and heavy pack on
my back for the first time. Oh boy! There's a lot of stuff in there.</p>

<p>I was on the road from my Madison Park apartment by a little after 8:00am after
an initial shouldering of the heavy pack just to get it to the car. Google routed me through the
Edmonds-Kingston ferry, on which the loudspeakers urged people to stay in their
cars in accordance with state government recommendations to prevent the spread of 
Covid-19. Drove off the ferry and stopped at a roadside coffee stand to pick
up a last hemp latte before foregoing the luxuries of civilization. I finally arrived at Rialto Beach 
around 12:15pm, donned my kneepads and walked the length of the main parking lot to check the
information table, which I scanned casually without thinking there might be any relevant information
I didn't already know. Ellen Creek, for example, was marked as the southern boundary
of acceptable campsites, but I already knew that.</p>

<p>I figured I could make the 0.8 miles to Ellen Creek, which one online source
reduced to 0.5 miles, in 
20 minutes, leaving plenty of daylight to set up camp and maybe even get 
a fire going. Wishful thinking had me using the shorter
distance. You're supposed to camp north of Ellen Creek, 
which some YouTubers said they completely missed on the way to Hole-in-the-Wall, 
which is the huge boulder with a big hole in it. I hadn't fully
appreciated the fact that they were all there in summer. Completely different.
So struggling under the load of my 60-pound backpack, I set out trying 
to get as far inland as possible. I was really picturing the campsites as on 
one of those bluffs over the beach, like at Ruby Beach, not directly exposed 
to the tide in the area directly on the beach. Again wishful
thinking. The waves from the Pacific crashing in with a cyclical roar,
while sea birds
and bald eagles soar overhead scanning for fish, are gorgeous in
their calm, overwhelming power yet also commanding of great respect. 
They will keep rolling in and out whether I'm there or not. It
is those same waves that have washed in huge fir and cedar logs
weighing tens of tons, some maybe as long as 50 meters and up to
2 meters in diameter. So I tried to avoid 
the beach by hypothesizing a trail in the woods more uphill. I kind of blazed 
this trail myself and ended up hiking through thick cane-like vegetation until I finally 
headed down toward the beach as the only viable path forward. And then one of 
the tides that comes in really far led me to think that what I had crossed 
was the "ankle-deep" Ellen Creek, to which I wanted to be close, as that was supposed to be my fresh-water source.</p>

<p>So, I found a spot that looked to me like it was
<em>probably</em>
away from the tide that must be where people have camped before.
But there was no level area, and I really hate sleeping on a
slant. So I took out my shovel and spent quite a bit of time
leveling out a spot in the rock and coarse sand before setting up
the tent. I was worried  that that might not have been Ellen
Creek, but felt like I hadn't lost a lot of time setting up the
tent. It was the leveling in the sandy river rock that was a bit
time-consuming. About the time I was finishing up with the tent,
a couple in their thirties came up to ask if I knew when to
expect high and low tide. They thought that one of the two was
at 7:30pm, and this whole discussion started worrying me about
whether my tent was actually above the high water mark. I didn't
want to wake up in the middle of the night with the tide
invading my tent. I realized that this would actually be
life-threatening without quick, appropriate action. I decided
that if the tide should start getting the tent wet, I could as last resort grab my pair of
pants with wallet and car keys and at least make it back to the
car, abandoning all the rest of my gear if necessary.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I had smelled the smoke from a nice fire a guy was
building just north of what I had imagined was Ellen
Creek. So I walked over and asked about the tide and if that was
Ellen Creek right there. In what I think was a Russian accent,
he responded, "No, Ellen Creek is much much further,
another half mile. There are campsites there that are higher,
and safer from the tide." So I walked back to the parking lot
to look at a map and on the way
spoke with an older couple who seemed quite familiar with the
area. They said the same as the Russian and suggested consulting
the tide chart on the information panel to be sure about when to
expect high tide and how high it would be. High tide wasn't, I
discovered, a simple 24-hour cycle with high tide being at a
certain time and low tide offset by 12 hours. There were
multiple high and low tides every day, and one of the high ones
was at 2:35am. So I walked even
further this time, and sure enough, there was Ellen Creek. And
fortuitously there was a dude there with bare feet saying that
the best way to cross was just to go barefoot. I would have
thought that a bit hardcore if I hadn't talked to him, so I have
to thank him that I didn't try with my boots and get them
literally filled with water. Fortunately, and not having really
excluded the possibility that I had been mistaken at first about
Ellen Creek, I hadn't unpacked everything there until doing
further research, but I still had to tear down the tent and
tether it onto my backpack.</p>

<p>It was dark by then, so I had to start working by the light
of my brand new rechargeable headlamp, the operation of which I
also had to figure out, specifically how it cycles through
various modes and which mode was best for conserving energy
while still having acceptable visibility. I didn't even have
camp set up yet and didn't know how long that was going to take.
I did know that in the new camp, I had a good area of level sand
to set up the tent and a firepit from previous occupants at the
new location, which did seem higher and better protected from
the tide.
In a hurry to settle in now that I was running way behind
schedule, I packed the outer shell of the tent pretty
haphazardly and tethered it together so I thought it would hold.
I was already entertaining the question of whether or not I
should turn back but thought this first obstacle easily
surmountable. I couldn't envision
anything life-threatening arising from this first big mistake. I had been nourishing
myself with trail mix the whole time, which I feel like at least
has good carbs and protein.</p>

<p>Shortly before reaching Ellen Creek, I felt the tent slipping
off the pack, and when I went to put it back, I saw that the
haphazardly packed yet absolutely essential tent cover had fallen off! So ... I now take off
the pack, which was probably all for the better anyway before
crossing the creek, and walk all the way back to the original
campsite, which I now have to recognize in darkness, with no
luck finding the cover. On the way back to the backpack, I
decide that if I can't find the tent cover, I'll have to head
back to Seattle. I can't spend the night with lows around
1&#176; C. without a fully functional tent.</p>

<p>In a last ditch effort before giving up, I walk back up a bit
further toward Ellen Creek, and <em>there</em> is the tent cover. I
put it back on quite securely this time, albeit still a bit
sloppy
and proceed onward a short distance to Ellen Creek, take off my
boots and socks and turn up my pants to wade a rushing stream in
6&#176; C., all while carrying a 60-pound pack
that was cumbersome to put back on once really off.
Then I waded across a river bed of sand and river rocks while being absolutely
sure not to lose my boots and socks in the rushing stream that
wasn't high but was powerful enough to throw you off balance a
little.</p>
<p>Having traversed the stream, I tried to brush the tiny
pebbles off my feet before putting my shoes and socks back on
with feet still fairly wet. The elevated campsite area had an obvious and nice
spot for the tent a safe distance from the fire and hopeful
cooking area, which would be where my predecessors had made
their fire pit and even bequeethed some half-burned logs. The
camp was all on lovely soft sand with only the occasional river
rock interspersed.
Tent setup was easy, and I could finally
unpack and settle down.</p>
